# Documentation Rules - Mandatory

This project is designed to be **educational**. Documentation is part of the product.

## Scope

Any new feature or architectural change must update docs in `docs/` when applicable.

## Requirements

When adding a feature:

- Add/Update docs in **both** languages:
  - English: `docs/**/*.en.md`
  - Portuguese: `docs/**/*.pt.md`
- Update:
  - `docs/workflows/adding-a-feature.*` if the workflow changes
  - `docs/architecture/*` if dependency flow/layering changes
  - `docs/patterns/*` if a new pattern is introduced
  - `docs/reference/glossary.*` if new terminology is added

## Quality bar

Docs should include:

- Purpose
- When to use
- Minimal example
- Common mistakes
- Links (official docs + high-quality references)
