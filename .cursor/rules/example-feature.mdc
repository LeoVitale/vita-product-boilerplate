# Example Feature: Tasks

## Important Context

The `Tasks` feature in this boilerplate is an **EDUCATIONAL EXAMPLE** designed to demonstrate Clean Architecture patterns. It is NOT meant for production use.

## Location of Example Code

The Tasks example exists in:

- `packages/domain/src/features/tasks/` - Domain layer example
- `packages/application/src/features/tasks/` - Application layer example
- `packages/infrastructure/src/features/tasks/` - Infrastructure layer example
- `packages/graphql/src/queries/tasks.graphql` - GraphQL operations
- `apps/api/src/tasks/` - Backend module
- `apps/web/app/page.tsx` - Web UI using Tasks
- `apps/mobile/src/screens/TaskListScreen.tsx` - Mobile UI using Tasks

## Rules for AI Assistants

### DO NOT

- Reference Tasks code when implementing new features for production
- Copy Tasks code directly without explaining it's an example
- Assume the user wants to keep Tasks in their final product
- Add new functionality to the Tasks feature

### DO

- Use Tasks as a **reference** when explaining architecture patterns
- Recommend cleanup before starting a new product: `pnpm clean:example`
- Point users to the cleanup documentation: `docs/getting-started/clean-slate.en.md`
- Generate new features using the generator: `./scripts/generate-feature.sh <name>`

### When User Asks to Add a Feature

1. First ask: "Have you removed the example Tasks feature, or would you like to keep it for reference?"
2. If not cleaned, suggest: "Run `pnpm clean:example` first, or I can work alongside the example."
3. Generate the new feature using the proper generator script
4. Do NOT base new features on Tasks code structure - use the patterns, not the specifics

### Cleanup Commands

```bash
# Remove example feature
pnpm clean:example
./scripts/clean-example.sh

# Verify clean state
pnpm verify:clean
./scripts/verify-clean.sh

# Generate new feature
./scripts/generate-feature.sh my-feature
```

## Why This Matters

- Users cloning this boilerplate want to build their OWN products
- Tasks is just a teaching tool, not a starting point
- Keeping example code leads to confusion and technical debt
- A clean start is the proper way to use a boilerplate
